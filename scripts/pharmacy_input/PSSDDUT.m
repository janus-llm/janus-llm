 ;;  This is the frequency (ONLY) with which the doses are to be
 ;;administered.  Several forms of entry are acceptable, such as
 ;;Q6H, 09-12-15, STAT, QOD, and MO-WE-FR@AD (where MO-WE-FR are
 ;;days of the week, and AD is the admin times).  The schedule
 ;;will show on the MAR, labels, etc.  No more than ONE space
 ;;(Q3H 4 or Q4H PRN) in the schedule is acceptable.  If the
 ;;letters PRN ;;are found as part of the schedule, no admin
 ;;times will print on the MAR or labels, and the PICK LIST will
 ;;always show a count of zero (0).
 ;;Avoid using notation such as W/F (with food) or WM (with meals)
 ;;in the schedule as it may cause erroneous calculations.  That
 ;;information should be entered into the SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS.
 ;;  When using the MO-WE-FR@AD schedule, please remember that
 ;;this type of schedule will not work properly without the "@"
 ;;character and at least one admin time, and that at least the
 ;;first two letters of each weekday entered is needed.
