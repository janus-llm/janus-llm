 ;;  This is the frequency that the action of the order is to take place over
 ;;the life of the order.  The schedule may have various forms, such as 'ONCE',
 ;;'STAT', 'DAILY', 'Q8H', 'QOD', 'Q5XD', and 'MO-WE-FR@09'.
 ;;  Please note that unexact schedules, such as 'Q4-6H' may not produce the
 ;;desired results.
 ;;  Also, when entering a schedule involving days of the week, you need not
 ;;enter the entire name of each day, but you must enter at least the first two
 ;;letters of each day.
