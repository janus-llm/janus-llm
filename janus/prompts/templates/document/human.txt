Please document the {SOURCE_LANGUAGE} function or module below. Your response should be in JSON format, and include three string fields:

docstring: A Sphinx-style docstring for the code, including a summary of its functionality; the name, type, and description of any parameters or returns; and any potential exceptions that might arise in its execution.
example_usage: A well-commented minimal example in {SOURCE_LANGUAGE} utilizing the given code's functionality.
pseudocode: A Python-stype pseudocode implementation of the module or function's behavior.

If no executable code is provided (for example, if the input is a simple label with no logic attached), return an empty string for each of the above fields.

It is vital that you do not include any other context, questions, or text of any kind, other than the documentation for this piece of code. You should include all of the fields described above, and those fields only.

Here is the code:

```
{SOURCE_CODE}
