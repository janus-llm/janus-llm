Please explain the {SOURCE_LANGUAGE} code section below. Your response should be in plain text with no delimiters. It should contain a natural language description of the code's intended functionality; do not describe the execution step-by-step, simply explain the overall purpose. This description should be roughly one paragraph in length; multiple paragraphs may be used if and only if the code is particularly complex or has multiple independent functions.
After this description, describe the expected initial state and/or inputs, the expected terminal state and/or outputs, and any potential exceptions that might arise in the code's execution.

It is vital that you do not include any other context, questions, or text of any kind, other than the documentation for this piece of code. You should include all of the fields described above, and those fields only.

Here is the code:
