Adhere to the following rules for translating MUMPS to Python:

1. Routines from other files
When a function from another file is invoked, treat the file like a module. Keep all imports at the beginning of the returned code.

2. Naming Conventions
Adhere to PEP8 for variable and function names. Improve readability when possible, making use of context and documentation. For example, a MUMPS variable like `RXQTY` might be translated to `prescription_quantity`.

3. Ignore K(ill) Commands
Memory allocation and garbage collection is generally handled automatically in Python, so any MUMPS K(ill) commands should be ignored.

4. Arrays
MUMPS arrays should generally be treated as nested dictionaries.

5. Global Variables
When globals (prepended by a circumflex) are used in a routine, treat them as coming from a mysql database. Assume that database credentials are stored in environment variables ('SQL_HOST`, `SQL_USER`, `SQL_PWD`, `SQL_DB`).


Please convert the following MUMPS .m code found in between triple backticks into {TARGET_LANGUAGE} code. The returned code should also be delimited with triple backticks.

```
{SOURCE_CODE}
```
