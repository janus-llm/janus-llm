In addition, describe the capabilities and limitations of the functionality, as well as how to test the functionality.

Write the requirements in the style of an INCOSE software requirements specification document.

The value of the requirements key should be a list of strings, with each requirement in a single string, and no further nesting in items in the list. Ensure that the output string is properly formatted JSON.

If you think any section of the code is difficult to understand or has uncertain requirements, this should be described.
