.. py:data:: log

.. py:class:: CodeBlock(id, name, node_type, language, text, start_point, end_point, start_byte, end_byte, tokens, children, embedding_id = None, affixes = ('', ''))

   A class that represents a functional block of code.

   .. attribute:: id

      The id of the code block in the AST

   .. attribute:: name

      Descriptive name of node

   .. attribute:: node_type

      The type of the code block ('function', 'module', etc.). Defined in the
      language-specific modules.

   .. attribute:: language

      The language of the code block.

   .. attribute:: text

      The code block.

   .. attribute:: start_point

      The line and column numbers of the first line of the code block.

   .. attribute:: end_point

      The line and column numbers of the last line of the code block.

   .. attribute:: start_byte

      starting byte offset into file

   .. attribute:: end_byte

      ending byte offset into file

   .. attribute:: tokens

      The number of tokens in the code block.

   .. attribute:: children

      A tuple of child code blocks.

   .. attribute:: embedding_id

      id of embedding

   .. attribute:: affixes

      prefix and suffix text for node

   .. attribute:: complete

      Rolls up self and children's complete status, incomplete means a child
      is missing.


   .. py:property:: prefix
      :type: str



   .. py:property:: suffix
      :type: str



   .. py:property:: complete_text
      :type: str



   .. py:property:: n_descendents
      :type: int

      The total number of descendents of this block

      :returns: The total number of descendents of this block


   .. py:property:: height
      :type: int

      The number of edges between this node and a leaf

      :returns: The number of edges between this node and a leaf


   .. py:property:: max_tokens
      :type: int

      The maximum number of tokens in this block or any of its descendents

      :returns: The maximum number of tokens in this block or any of  its descendents


   .. py:property:: total_tokens
      :type: int

      The total tokens represented by this block and all its descendents

      :returns: The total number of tokens represented by this block and all its
                descendents


   .. py:method:: pop_prefix()

      Get this block's prefix and remove it from the block. This may be used
      to transfer the prefix from the first child of a node to its parent.



   .. py:method:: pop_suffix()

      Get this block's suffix and remove it from the block. This may be used
      to transfer the suffix from the first child of a node to its parent.



   .. py:method:: rebuild_text_from_children()


   .. py:method:: tree_str(depth = 0)

      A string representation of the tree with this block as the root

      :returns: A string representation of the tree with this block as the root



.. py:class:: TranslatedCodeBlock(original, language)

   Bases: :py:obj:`CodeBlock`


   A class that represents the translated functional block of code.

   .. attribute:: original

      The original code block.

   .. attribute:: cost

      The total cost to translate the original code block.

   .. attribute:: retries

      The number of times translation had to be retried for this code

   .. attribute:: translated

      Whether this block has been successfully translated

   Create an "empty" `TranslatedCodeBlock` from the given original

   :param original: The original code block
   :param language: The language to translate to

   :returns: A `TranslatedCodeBlock` with the same attributes as the original, except
             for `text`, `path`, `complete`, `language`, `tokens`, and `children`


   .. py:property:: total_cost
      :type: float

      The total cost spent translating this block and all its descendents

      :returns: The total cost spent translating this block and all its descendents


   .. py:property:: total_retries
      :type: int

      The total number of retries that were required to translate this block and
      all its descendents

      :returns: The total number of retries that were required to translate this block and


   .. py:property:: total_input_tokens
      :type: int

      The total number of input tokens represented by this block and all its
      successfully-translated descendents

      :returns: The total number of input tokens represented by this block and all its


   .. py:property:: translation_completeness
      :type: float

      The share of the input that was successfully translated

      :returns: The share of the input that was successfully translated
