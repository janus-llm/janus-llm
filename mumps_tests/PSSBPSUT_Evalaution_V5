Performance: 4
The requirements clearly define the inputs and outputs of the functions, as well as the expected behavior in different scenarios. However, there is room for improvement in terms of performance. For example, there is no mention of any constraints or performance requirements for the calculations in the NCPDPQTY function, such as the maximum allowed value for RXQTY or the maximum execution time.

Explainability: 5
The requirements are well-explained and easy to follow. Each requirement is clearly stated and provides sufficient information to understand the expected behavior of the system. The use of examples and specific terminology helps to clarify the requirements.

Calibration: 5
There are no logical inconsistencies or duplicated requirements in the document. Each requirement is unique and contributes to the overall functionality of the system.

Faithfulness: 4
The requirements are closely related to the source code. They accurately describe the inputs, outputs, and behavior of the functions. However, there are a few requirements that could be more explicit, such as specifying the format of the string returned by the NCPDPQTY function or providing more details about the ePharmacy Billable fields in the EPHARM function.

Overall, the quality of the requirements is good, with clear explanations and minimal inconsistencies. However, there is room for improvement in terms of performance considerations and providing more explicit details in some requirements.
