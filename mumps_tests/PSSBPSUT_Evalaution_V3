Performance: 4
The requirements clearly define the inputs and outputs of the functions NCPDPQTY and EPHARM. They also specify the conditions under which the functions should return certain values. However, there is no mention of any performance requirements such as response time or throughput.

Explainability: 5
The requirements are explained in a clear and concise manner. Each requirement is numbered and provides a clear description of what the system should do. The use of examples and references to specific fields in the source code helps to clarify the requirements.

Calibration: 4
There are no logical inconsistencies or duplicated requirements in the document. Each requirement is unique and addresses a specific aspect of the system's functionality. However, there is some overlap between the two functions, as they both involve checking and updating fields in the DRUG file.

Faithfulness: 3
The requirements are closely related to the source code and accurately describe the functionality of the functions. However, there are a few requirements that are more generalized and could be made more specific. For example, requirement 14 states that the function should retrieve the existing values for the ePharmacy Billable fields, but it does not specify where these values should be stored or how they should be accessed.
