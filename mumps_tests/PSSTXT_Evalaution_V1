Performance: 4
The requirements are clear and specific, and they align well with the source code. However, there are a few requirements that could be more explicit, such as requirement 5 which states "If the user chooses to review the list, the system shall display all entries in the Drug file or Orderable Item file that are linked to the selected drug." It would be helpful to specify how the system should display the list, such as in a table or a list format.

Explainability: 4
The requirements are generally clear and easy to follow. Each requirement is written in a concise manner, and the overall structure of the document is well-organized. However, there are a few requirements that could be more explicit, such as requirement 10 which states "If the user chooses to edit the Drug Text Name, the system shall display the current Drug Text Name and prompt the user to enter a new Drug Text Name." It would be helpful to provide more detailed instructions on how the system should prompt the user to enter a new Drug Text Name.

Calibration: 3
There are no logical inconsistencies or duplicated requirements in the document. However, there are a few requirements that could be combined or rephrased to improve clarity. For example, requirements 6 and 20 both mention the absence of text lines causing the Drug Text entry to be completely deleted. These requirements could be combined into a single requirement to avoid repetition.

Faithfulness: 4
All of the requirements are directly related to the source code and describe the functionality that should be implemented. However, there are a few requirements that could be more specific and explicitly tied to the source code. For example, requirement 9 states "The system shall prompt the user to edit the Drug Text Name." It would be helpful to specify where and how the system should prompt the user, such as through a dialog box or a command line interface.
