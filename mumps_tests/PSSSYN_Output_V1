Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

1. The system shall implement a billing drug count checker functionality.
2. The system shall add synonyms from the drug file (file number 50) to the orderable item file.
3. The system shall use the Pharmacy Data Management module.
4. The system shall have a version number of 1.0.
5. The system shall have a release date of September 30, 1997.

6. The system shall perform the following steps:
   a. Loop through all entries in the drug file (file number 50).
   b. Check if the entry has a corresponding entry in the second node of the drug file.
   c. If a corresponding entry exists, retrieve the orderable item from the second node.
   d. Check if the orderable item exists in the 50.7 file.
   e. If the orderable item exists, proceed to the next step.
   f. If the orderable item does not exist, skip to the next drug file entry.
   
7. The system shall perform the following steps for each drug file entry with a corresponding orderable item:
   a. Check if the drug file entry has a sub-node with entries.
   b. If sub-node entries exist, loop through each entry.
   c. Retrieve the "IUSE" field from the sub-node entry.
   d. Check if the "IUSE" field is equal to 0 or empty.
   e. If the "IUSE" field is equal to 0 or empty, proceed to the next step.
   f. If the "IUSE" field is not equal to 0 or empty, skip to the next sub-node entry.
   
8. The system shall perform the following steps for each sub-node entry with "IUSE" equal to 0 or empty:
   a. Retrieve the synonym from the sub-node entry.
   b. Check if the synonym exists in the "C" cross-reference of the 50.7 file.
   c. If the synonym does not exist, proceed to the next step.
   d. If the synonym exists, skip to the next sub-node entry.
   
9. The system shall perform the following steps for each synonym that does not exist in the "C" cross-reference:
   a. Add the synonym to the corresponding orderable item in the 50.7 file.
   b. Set the parent entry to the orderable item.
   c. Set the synonym value.
   d. Save the record in the 50.72 sub-file.
   
10. The system shall perform the following steps to update the "C" cross-reference:
    a. Clear the existing "C" cross-reference.
    b. Loop through each entry in the 50.7 file.
    c. Loop through each entry in the 50.7 sub-file.
    d. Retrieve the synonym from the sub-file entry.
    e. Update the "C" cross-reference with the synonym, parent entry, and sub-file entry.

11. The system shall replicate the functionality of the MUMPS code in Python.

Dependencies:
- The system shall have access to the drug file (file number 50) and the orderable item file.
- The system shall use the Pharmacy Data Management module.
- The system shall have access to the 50.7 file.

Note: The MUMPS code provided may require further understanding and analysis by an M programmer to fully replicate its functionality in Python.
