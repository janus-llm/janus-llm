Requirements:

1. The system shall provide an API for retrieving information from file 54 in the Pharmacy Data Management system.
2. The system shall accept the following inputs for the API:
   a. PSSIEN - The IEN (Internal Entry Number) of the entry in the RX CONSULT file (#54).
   b. PSSFT - The free text name in the RX CONSULT file (#54).
   c. LIST - The subscript of the ^TMP array where the data will be stored.
3. The system shall return the following data from the RX CONSULT file (#54) for the given inputs:
   a. NAME field (#.01)
   b. TEXT field (#1)
4. If the LIST input is not provided, the system shall not perform any operations and return no data.
5. If both PSSIEN and PSSFT inputs are not provided, the system shall set the first element of the ^TMP array to -1^"NO DATA FOUND".
6. If PSSIEN is provided and its value is less than or equal to 0, the system shall set the first element of the ^TMP array to -1^"NO DATA FOUND".
7. If PSSIEN is provided and its value is greater than 0, the system shall perform the following operations:
   a. Find the IEN of the entry in the RX CONSULT file (#54) using the FIND1^DIC function.
   b. If the IEN is not found, the system shall set the first element of the ^TMP array to -1^"NO DATA FOUND".
   c. If the IEN is found, the system shall set the first element of the ^TMP array to 1.
   d. Retrieve the NAME field (#.01) and TEXT field (#1) of the RX CONSULT file (#54) using the GETS^DIQ function.
   e. Store the retrieved data in the ^TMP array under the appropriate subscripts.
8. If PSSIEN is not provided and PSSFT is provided, the system shall perform the following operations:
   a. If PSSFT contains the string "??", the system shall loop through all entries in the RX CONSULT file (#54) and retrieve the NAME field (#.01) and TEXT field (#1) for each entry.
   b. If PSSFT does not contain the string "??", the system shall find the entries in the RX CONSULT file (#54) that match the PSSFT value using the FIND^DIC function.
   c. If no matching entries are found, the system shall set the first element of the ^TMP array to -1^"NO DATA FOUND".
   d. If matching entries are found, the system shall set the first element of the ^TMP array to the number of matching entries.
   e. Retrieve the NAME field (#.01) of the matching entries using the GETS^DIQ function.
   f. Store the retrieved data in the ^TMP array under the appropriate subscripts.
9. The system shall provide an API for looking up entries in the RX CONSULT file (#54) based on the NAME field.
10. The system shall accept the following inputs for the lookup API:
    a. PSSSRCH - The IEN of the entry in the RX CONSULT file (#54).
    b. LIST - The subscript of the ^TMP array where the data will be stored.
11. The system shall return the NAME field (#.01) of the RX CONSULT file (#54) for the given input.
12. If the LIST input is not provided, the system shall not perform any operations and return no data.
13. If the PSSSRCH input is not provided, the system shall set the first element of the ^TMP array to -1^"NO DATA FOUND".
14. The system shall find the entries in the RX CONSULT file (#54) that match the PSSSRCH value using the FIND^DIC function.
15. If no matching entries are found, the system shall set the first element of the ^TMP array to -1^"NO DATA FOUND".
16. If matching entries are found, the system shall set the first element of the ^TMP array to the number of matching entries.
17. Retrieve the NAME field (#.01) of the matching entries using the GETS^DIQ function.
18. Store the retrieved data in the ^TMP array under the appropriate subscripts.
