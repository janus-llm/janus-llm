Performance: 4
The requirements are generally well-defined and match the source code. However, there is room for improvement in terms of specifying performance requirements, such as response times or throughput.

Explainability: 4
The requirements are clear and easy to follow. Each requirement is written in a concise manner and can be easily understood by a technical analyst.

Calibration: 3
There are no logical inconsistencies or duplicated requirements in the document. However, there is a slight overlap between requirements 6 and 13, which both state that the system shall perform common operations on the selected drug record.

Faithfulness: 4
All requirements are explicitly related to the source code and describe the expected behavior of the system. There are no generalized or unrelated requirements in the document.

Overall, the requirements documentation is of good quality, with clear and well-defined requirements that align with the source code. Some improvements can be made in terms of performance requirements and eliminating slight overlap between requirements.
