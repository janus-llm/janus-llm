# Contributing

Right now, submission of [issues](https://github.com/janus-llm/janus-llm/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/janus-llm/janus-llm/pulls) through GitHub is the best way to suggest changes, and those will have to be applied and merged on the internal MITRE GitLab and mirrored to GitHub. This process may change in the future.
